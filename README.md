This is a game in Vanilla js that I am making which involves launching a bomb and having it explode when it reaches the row of monsters closing in. There is supposed to be
three bombs for the player to launch, and the player can press and hold the bomb icon to toggle its power. When the bomb explodes in front of the row of monsters, they are
supposed to advance forward more quickly. And that is the game for the players to play. The toggle bomb power and the monster response from the bomb exploding features are
still being worked on. 

LAUNCHING THE GAME - Simply open the index.html file in a browser (Chrome is recommended)
